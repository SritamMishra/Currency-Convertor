## 💡 Why I Made This Project

As a freshman just starting my programming journey, I wanted to go beyond “Hello World” and try building something **practical** and **interactive** — but still simple enough to code with what I knew.

Most currency converters rely on APIs and external libraries. But I challenged myself to build one that works completely offline — no imports, no internet, no shortcuts.

This project helped me:
- Apply basic Python concepts in a real-world scenario
- Design a clean, user-friendly command-line experience
- Build confidence in writing structured, readable code without relying on tutorials

> 📌 I believe even a beginner project can stand out — if it’s made with intention, polish, and creativity.

This converter reflects that belief. It's proof that I take coding seriously from day one.
